Put your built installers in this folder so Render can serve them directly.

- macOS: `download/assets/OGforge-mac.dmg`
- Windows: `download/assets/OGforge-win.exe`

After adding the files, commit and push. Your Render static site will then download these files directly (no GitHub Releases needed).

Note: DMG/EXE files can be large; GitHub repos have size limits. If you hit limits, use GitHub Releases instead.
